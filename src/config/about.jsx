		text: `GhostOpsAI is a tribute to the tactical roots of the original Ghost Recon, where players managed a roster of elite operators, each with unique skills and limited availability. In that classic game, every decision mattered: if a Ghost was wounded or KIA, they were out for good, forcing players to think strategically and value every operator's life. That core concept of consequence and realism inspired the foundation of this project.
    GhostOpsAI brings that immersive experience into Ghost Recon Breakpoint, blending real-time operator status management with an AI-driven mission planning system. Players can assign their operators to dynamic recon, assault, and rescue operations, each carrying risk of losing an operator. Injuries and losses are tracked, creating a persistent and evolving battlefield.
    A major component of the project is the mission generator which was inspired by RGJP’s incredible work on the original Ghost Recon Breakpoint mission generator. With RGJP's permission, this feature was re-imagined and integrated into GhostOpsAI, allowing players to generate realistic, AI-assisted missions based on terrain, enemy intel, and operational goals.
    This project is more than just a game tool—it’s a living simulation for fans of tactical realism and strategic planning.`,
