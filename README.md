## Architecture

![GhostOpsAI AWS Architecture](docs/GhostopsAI_Diagram.png)

The platform runs entirely on AWS. DNS and WAF sit in front of CloudFront, which routes traffic to the Amplify-hosted frontend and the LightSail Express backend. Cognito handles authentication. MongoDB stores all operational data. Two independent **Serverless Recovery Engines** (Step Functions + Lambda + EventBridge) drive the infirmary recovery timer and the vehicle repair workflow. AI mission generation is powered by **Groq**.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Framework | React 18 + Vite |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 |
| Routing | React Router DOM v7 |
| State Management | Zustand |
| Authentication | AWS Cognito via `react-oidc-context` |
| HTTP Client | Axios |
| Maps | Leaflet |
| Icons | FontAwesome 6 |
| Notifications | React Toastify |
| Build | Vite + Rollup with manual chunk splitting |

## Routes

| Path | Access | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `/` | Public | Landing page |
| `/login` | Public | Sign in |
| `/dashboard` | Protected | Main command dashboard |
| `/dashboard/roster` | Protected | Operator roster |
| `/dashboard/teams` | Protected | Team management |
| `/dashboard/infirmary` | Protected | Injury tracking |
| `/dashboard/memorial` | Protected | KIA memorial |
| `/dashboard/garage` | Protected | Vehicle fleet |
| `/dashboard/newOperator` | Protected | Create operator |
| `/dashboard/editOperator` | Protected | Edit operator |
| `/dashboard/newTeam` | Protected | Create team |
| `/dashboard/editTeam` | Protected | Edit team |

## Vehicle System

All vehicles use a unified **time-based fuel model** — no more separate fuel/battery/timer logic.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `maxTime` | Total operational minutes at full fuel (max 10 min) |
| `wearRate` | % wear added per minute of use |

**Condition thresholds** (driven by `wearPercent`):

| Wear % | Condition | Deployable |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| 0–24% | Optimal | Yes |
| 25–49% | Operational | Yes |
| 50–74% | Compromised | Yes |
| 75%+ | Critical | No — repair required |

Players input how long they want to use a vehicle (in minutes). The system calculates fuel consumed and wear added, then logs both to the backend.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- AWS Cognito User Pool

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/frontend-ghostops.git
cd frontend-ghostops
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-api.com/api
VITE_COGNITO_AUTHORITY=https://cognito-idp.<region>.amazonaws.com/<user-pool-id>
VITE_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
VITE_COGNITO_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5173
```

### Running Locally

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview
```

---

## Deployment

The app is deployed via **AWS Amplify**. Pushing to `main` triggers an automatic build and deploy.

Configuration is in `amplify.yml` at the project root.
